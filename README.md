# Relictus
_A Text Adventure._
Go to https://relictus.herokuapp.com to play.

## Gameplay
After waking up on a derelict ship, you control robots through a terminal screen in order to find some way to survive impending death, which could come from a stray asteroid, a misstep from your robots, or the atmosphere lying in wait for your re-entry. Try for the best score by the end of the game!

## Frameworks
This game is all built in JavaScript. I use React for the front-end, Redux for the state of the game and the rest of the logic is all vanilla js. Because of the unique design of this text adventure, and for the learning experience, I opted to make my own text parsing and game logic, rather than use another text adventure framework out there. Likely not most clean design, but feel free to look through and fork the project to create your own game.
